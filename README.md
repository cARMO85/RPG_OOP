# RPG OOP Battle Simulation

This project was inspired by a [learning guide](https://plainenglish.io/blog/learn-classes-by-making-a-game-in-python-5aedee38fc18) focusing on understanding Python classes through game development. I've expanded upon the concepts by simulating battles between different character types using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python and created a more intricate battle system. It serves both as a tribute to the original guide and as a testament to the power and flexibility of OOP in Python.

## Features

- **Character Types**: Three distinct character types (Fighter, Thief, Mage) each with unique attributes and battle capabilities.
- **Battle Mechanics**: A straightforward battle simulation where characters attack each other. Dodge and damage calculations are considered during fights.
- **Visual Representation**: Battle results are plotted using `matplotlib` to show which character type wins more frequently.

## Character Attributes

- **Fighter**: Balanced health and attack, with a lower dodge chance.
- **Thief**: Moderate health with a high dodge chance.
- **Mage**: Low health but a powerful attack capability.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python and `matplotlib` installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cARMO85/RPG_OOP.git
   cd RPG_OOP
   ```
3. Run the main script to simulate battles and see the results:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Contribution
Feel free to fork this project, make changes, and submit PRs. This project is a fun way to practice OOP and any enhancements or new character types would be welcomed.
